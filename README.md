## 🌟 About Me  
Hi there! I'm a passionate **engineering student** with a knack for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. I hold a degree in **Electronics Engineering** and am currently pursuing a Master's in **Robotics and Automation Engineering** at the University of Pisa.  

My main focus areas include:  
- 🤝 **Collaborative Robotics** – designing robots that work alongside humans.  
- 🚤 **Marine Robotics** – exploring underwater systems and autonomous navigation.  
- 🚗 **Automotive Applications** – advancing intelligent systems for vehicles.  

When I'm not designing robots, I spend my time running—and no, I'm not training robots to run... yet. 🏃‍♂️
